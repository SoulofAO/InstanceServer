This code was made at the request of my friend. 

This is the simplest Dedicaded Server initialization system in the process, not tied to standard solutions like Steam Lobby.
For the most part, the code is an example of the implementation of such a system and requires further development to suit your own situation.

You run a server, the main task of which is to create instances of server builds on the server at the request of the user with a sufficient number of players, and then send requests from the Unrea Engine [plugin](https://github.com/SoulofAO/InstanceServerPlugin).
The server and plugin has not been properly tested as of March 05, 2025. 

At the moment, you can see the side of the distributed server.
To start the server, use the shortcut in the dist folder. Make sure that you have configured the config file in same place for the settings you need, use example.
